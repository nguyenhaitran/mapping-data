This location allows for extended hang-time which yields fully developed aroma, flavor and tannin resulting in wine of intensity and depth. Dark cherry and plum provide mouth-filling intensity with a hint of carob and spice.", "80": "This wine offers generous aromas of ripe Bing cherries, blackberry, candied violets, cedar, and tobacco, plus hints of minerals and graphite. Sweet, densely packed and creamy in the mouth, but with firm, underlying structure that gives lift to the dark berry, chocolate, and coffee flavors. This is a very lush, soft, complex wine that coats the palate and spreads out on the long, lingering finish.", "427": "This is another big lusty 2011 vintage red blend from west Paso. Dry yet luscious fruit with lingering tannins and long, linear length on the finish.  Distinctive character, with rich palate coating textures and lots of layers and depth - this is benchmark wine.", "429": "Deep garnet in color, this wine bursts with aromas of sweetened cranberry, cassis, toasted marshmallow, charred dill and roasted red pepper. The aroma is smoky, complex and inviting. On the palate are notes of tart raspberry, spring cherry, and crunchy plum, leading to toffee and fresh roasted Arabica coffee beans, followed by dill, sage and lime zest. The finish is smooth with hints of smoke, cocoa, and unsweetened dried coconut.", "430": "The aromas of the 2016 Leese-Fitch Cabernet Sauvignon start with a sweet raspberry and licorice notes and finish with hints of root beer and cherry cola. The flavor palate includes touches of tart cherry and dark blackberry that are balanced with nuances of vanilla and sandlewood. The midpalate is medium-bodied with structured tannins as to be expected with Cabernet Sauvignon. The unique finish harmonizes flavors of dark fruit, rich American and French oak notes and candied orange peel.", "431": "A rich golden hue in color, this medium-bodied Chardonnay shows enticing aromas of spiced applesauce and citrus.

Just off-dry, the body of this wine is juicy with a crisp balanced acidity. ", "437": "2017 was a good vintage for Sauvignon Blanc. Moderate summer heat led to relatively early pick dates in order to get the Sauvignon Blanc off the vine with balanced acidity and ripeness. The flavors are highlighted by grassy herbal notes balanced with ripe melon and watermelon rind. On the palate, this light-bodied wine is juicy with casaba melon, lemon curd, and tangerine notes. Slight herbal nuances are framed with crisp acidity and finish with a touch of Meyer lemon.

", "690": "Ever the enigmatic beast, our 2010 Leviathan is trolling in deep, familiar waters. Harkening back to previous vintages, expressions of dark cherry, blueberry and blackberry exude from the glass.

", "777": "Positioned between brothers, Alec and Mason, Ethan gets a walk-off home run in his first at-bat since the 2005 vintage. At short-stop Ethan sees lots of action and his wine covers all the bases with black raspberry, yellow peach and pancetta, plus a field of lavender, licorice and violets. Like a seasoned glove the wine has a supple pocket of boysenberry fruit generously laced with sweet oak and vanilla spice. He keeps his eye on the ball and the wine stays focused though a vibrant, youthful finish, making the out on every play."}}
